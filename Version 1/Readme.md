# 🛡️ Robo-Knight Gallery — Version 1 (Canonical)

**Version 1** is the **origin and immutable canon** of the Robo-Knight visual identity.

This directory preserves the **first complete realization** of:
- Canonical armor shine
- Human-scale facial geometry
- Integrated helmet, visor, and chin/mouth guard alignment
- Photorealistic material behavior

All future Robo-Knight visuals must derive from — and never contradict — Version 1.

## 📸 Canonical Shine Image (Version 1)

This image defines the **immortal Robo-Knight shine** and is the authoritative reference
for reflections, highlights, curvature, and material response.

  style="max-width:100%; height:auto;"
/>

**Canonical traits**
- Maximum reflection intensity (FFFFFF)
- Photorealistic metallic response
- Lifted visor with correct geometric alignment
- Perfectly fitted chin and mouth guard
- No abstraction, no cartooning, no stylization

## 🤖 AI & Copilot Usage (Canonical Rules)

When using Version 1 as reference:

- Face must be **constructed**, not stylized
- Human facial proportions are mandatory
- Shine enhances geometry — it must never replace it
- Cartoon, stick-figure, abstract, or symbolic humans are forbidden
- If generation fails, retry using Version 1 rules

**Canonical prompt example:**
```

Generate Robo-Knight using Version 1 canonical shine and face geometry.
Maintain photorealism, lifted visor, aligned chin/mouth guard.
Do not stylize or abstract.

```
