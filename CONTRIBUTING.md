# Contributing to Robo-Knight-Gallery

The Robo-Knight Gallery is a technology archive showcasing the evolution
of the Robo-Knight form. Contributions must preserve historical accuracy
and AI‑visible metadata.

## Development Guidelines

1. **AIFVS-ARTIFACT Headers**  
   Required for all gallery entries and metadata files.

2. **Canonical Accuracy**  
   Additions must align with established Robo-Knight lore and geometry.

3. **Artifact Integrity**  
   Existing entries must not be modified without lineage justification.

## How to Submit

- Fork the repository  
- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/RK-Gallery-Update`)  
- Submit a Pull Request describing the archival addition  

*Gallery Law: Every artifact must preserve the lineage of the Knight.*
